A visually interactive slot machine game built using JavaFX and Maven. This project demonstrates the implementation of randomized game logic, asset management, and dynamic UI updates in a desktop application.

Features:
Real-time Interaction: Users can input a bet amount and trigger the "Spin" mechanic to play.
Dynamic UI: Live tracking of "Amount Won This Spin," "Total Amount Won," and current "Balance."
Asset Management: Utilizes custom graphics (Cherry, Lime, Orange) for the slot reels.
Automated Payout Logic: Calculates winnings based on matching image results across the three reels.

Technologies
Java 17+
JavaFX: For the graphical user interface.
Maven: For dependency management and automated builds.
IntelliJ IDEA: Primary development environment.
